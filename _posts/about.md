title: "About AwakeAI Inc."
excerpt: "Based on cutting-edge artificial intelligence vision technology, we’ve adopted generative models that surpass traditional skeletal models. This enables more in-depth and detailed analysis of vast video surveillance feeds in real-time, yielding more comprehensive and accurate results. This technology will first cater to elderly residents in homes or rehabilitation facilities. Through visual technology, there’s deep analysis of seniors’ daily living habits, diet, movements, interactions with caregivers, and other emergencies. The aim is to ensure the safety and health of the elderly from all perspectives. Leveraging distributed computing technology, the system can swiftly provide customized alerts for risks, conveying real-time information about the elderly, thus assisting caregivers and rehabilitation institutions in delivering top-notch care services."

## Product

# OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

AwakeAI system will install optical sensors in the resident's room, detect the senior’s activities, and send detected actions in concise textual information to the caregivers’ and their family members’ tablets or mobile phones (see diagram). Our system preserves client privacy by keeping all personal client information in secure servers and not needing to send identifiable information over the internet.

Our AI system can monitor activities that can be divided into 5 categories: emergencies, activity/physical status, diet/medicine intake, health, and human-human interactions. Our system can detect other activities based on a customization request. Furthermore, we are aiming to predict fall situations and help to prevent those.
